                Some Reddit communities are protesting due to recent announcement for API changes.
                The changes will introduce charges for API access that will kill third-party
                applications like Apollo, Boost, rif, and others.

              <p>
                With the recent protest and blackouts, I&apos;ve been trying to keep up with the
                communities I follow outside of Reddit. It&apos;s been a bit difficult to find where
                people went to. Some subreddits linked to Discord or Lemmy servers, but even then,
                when they are privated, the links are inaccessible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Iâ€™ve heard the same complaint from other people - subreddits are down, and people
                support the blackout, but finding alternatives is confusing, mostly because there
                are multiple platforms people jump over to.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I created https://sub.rehab to attempt to list where subreddits have moved to.
                It is open source, and edits can be suggested by anyone. It&apos;s obviously lacking
                content - these are just the subs I found on different platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think this could be useful, especially for subreddits planning an indefinite
                blackout - it would make it easier to discover alternatives.
